Enjoy this absolute beauty that I spent too much time on. It's perfection. Please note these things.

- This program was made on my computer, which is a Mac, so I don't know how well it'll work on yours. Let's hope for the best I guess.

- you'll probably have to enable processing to access you camera for this. I enabled an option to skip the camera part, but it might just force you to enable camera access because my program has the camera in it.

- Also, this beauty is pretty demanding for your computer, and un-optimized as heck, and depending on how well your computer... computes, it might really put some stress on your computer.
