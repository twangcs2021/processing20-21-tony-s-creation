Enjoy this absolute beauty. Please note these things.

- This program was made on my computer, which is a Mac, so I don't know how well it'll work on yours. Let's hope for the best I guess.

- you'll probably have to enable processing to access you camera for this. I enabled an option to skip the camera part, but it might just force you to enable camera access because my program has the camera in it.

- Also, this beauty is pretty demanding for your computer, and un-optimized as heck, and depending on how well your computer... computes, it might really put some stress on your computer. 

To fully enjoy everything I've put in this game, do these things:
- get to at least 50 points (something happens then)
- When dying, wait a few secnods to see where the song goes
- Restart the game 6 times to enjoy all 6 of the unique songs I added to the game
- In the instructions screen, try pressing both b and p
- Try to get a good score!

Also, my dad thinks it wasn't obvious enough that you have to use the mouse to aim.
So, for everyone reading this, you have to use the mouse pointer to aim, and click the left mouse button to shoot.


There are 8 unique songs that play during this game, 6 of which alternate during the cow section. I'd recommend listening to them in game, but here are the Youtube links if you want to hear more.
